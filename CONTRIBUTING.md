# Contributing to Project NOW

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! This document outlines how to get started with contributing to **Project NOW**, along with the standards and approval process required.

---

## 📦 Project Setup

If this is your first time contributing:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account:  
   https://github.com/lehlud/Project-NOW/fork

2. **Clone** your fork:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Project-NOW.git
    cd Project-NOW
    ```

3. Set the **original repository** as an upstream remote:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/lehlud/Project-NOW.git
    ```

## 🌿 Branching & Workflow

1. Always create a new branch for your work:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-name
    ```
2. If your branch is a small fix simply name it. But if it's a major bugfix or new feature you must name it as fix/your-feature-name or feature/your-feature-name

3. Keep your fork up to date:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```
4. Push your changes
    ```
    git push origin your-feature-name
    ```

## 🧹 Code Style & Formatting

We use **Prettier** for formatting. You **must format your code** before submitting a PR.

**Prettier Settings:**

Default settings, but we use tab width 4.

If using VScode / VSCodium or any other fork, open Command Palette by `Ctrl+Shift+P` and then type `Open User Settings` and select option with **JSON**, then you can set these parameters for Prettier:

```json
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"prettier.tabWidth": 4,
```

## 🧠 Code Quality Guidelines

1. ✅ Write clean, modular, and dynamic code

2. 🧼 Avoid hardcoding whenever possible

3. 💬 Use comments for non-trivial logic or important context

4. 🚫 Avoid huge PRs – break things into smaller changes where possible

5. 🧪 If applicable, add test coverage or usage examples

## ✅ Pull Request Process

1. Push your branch to your fork

2. Open a Pull Request to the master branch of our repo.

3. Include a clear title and description of the changes made.

4. **PR Review Requirements:**

- Your PR must be approved by **both**:
    - @AstralVixen
    - @t0msk
